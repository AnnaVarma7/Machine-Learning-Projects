🍔 Food Delivery Time Prediction
This project aims to predict real-time food delivery times using machine learning. Companies like Zomato and Swiggy rely on such models to estimate delivery durations and ensure transparency with customers.

📌 Problem Statement
Accurate prediction of delivery time depends on various factors such as:
Distance between the restaurant and delivery location
Age and ratings of the delivery partner
Type of food and vehicle used
This project explores these features and trains a neural network model to predict delivery time in minutes.

📁 Dataset Overview
🔢 Records: 45,593
📄 File: deliverytime.txt
🚚 Target: Time_taken(min)

🧾 Key Features:
Delivery_person_Age
Delivery_person_Ratings
Restaurant_latitude/longitude
Delivery_location_latitude/longitude
Type_of_order
Type_of_vehicle

📍 Feature Engineering
Calculated geodesic distance using the Haversine formula
Identified top factors impacting delivery time:
Partner’s age and rating
Distance between restaurant and customer

📊 Exploratory Analysis
📈 Distance vs Time: Positive correlation

👤 Partner Age vs Time: Older partners may be quicker
⭐ Ratings vs Time: Better-rated partners tend to deliver faster
🍱 Vehicle & Order Type: Motorcycles perform better for snacks
🧠 Model Building
Model: LSTM Neural Network

Inputs: Delivery_person_Age, Delivery_person_Ratings, distance
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(3, 1)))
model.add(LSTM(64, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(25))
model.add(Dense(1))
Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error
Trained for 9 epochs with batch size = 1

✅ Results
Training loss converged to ~69 MSE

Sample prediction: A 23-year-old partner with 1-star rating and 10km distance → ~33 mins

🛠️ Future Work
Add more dynamic features like traffic, weather
Optimize LSTM architecture and tune hyperparameters
Experiment with ensemble or gradient boosting models
