👥 K-Means Clustering for User Behavior Segmentation
This project leverages clustering techniques to profile users based on their online behavior, engagement metrics, and demographics. It helps uncover distinct user groups to drive data-informed, targeted marketing and product strategies.

🎯 Objective
To segment users into meaningful behavioral groups for:
Personalized marketing
Targeted ad campaigns
Better product recommendations

📁 Dataset Overview
Each row represents a unique user with attributes like:
Demographics: Age, Gender, Income, Education
Behavior: Time spent online, Likes, Reactions
Engagement: CTR, Conversion Rate, Ad Interaction
Interests: Top personal interests (e.g. Fitness, Tech, Gaming)
The dataset contains no missing values, making it ideal for modeling.

🔍 Key Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of demographics (age, gender, income)
Device usage analysis
Time spent online on weekdays vs. weekends
Engagement with ads and platform content
Interest profiling using frequency plots

2. Feature Selection
Features chosen for clustering:
Age
Gender
Income Level
Time Spent Online (weekday/weekend)
Likes and Reactions
Click-Through Rates (CTR)

3. Preprocessing
One-hot encoding of categorical variables
Standardization of numeric variables
Combined using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline

4. Clustering
KMeans clustering with 5 segments
Labels assigned and visualized

📊 Segment Summary
Cluster	Segment Name	Key Traits
0	Weekend Warriors	Active on weekends, moderate engagement, mid-to-high income
1	Engaged Professionals	High activity & CTR, balanced time online, mostly male
2	Low-Key Users	Modest engagement, weekday preference, moderate CTR
3	Active Explorers	High online time, lower CTR, high-income female users
4	Budget Browsers	Least engagement, lowest income, minimal ad interaction

📈 Visualization
EDA Charts: Seaborn barplots and histograms
Radar Chart: Using Plotly to compare clusters across key behavioral features

🧠 Tech Stack
Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)
scikit-learn (KMeans, pipelines, transformers)

✅ Outcomes
Segmented users into 5 data-driven personas
Created a foundation for targeted campaigns based on user profiles
Demonstrated the value of combining behavioral data with demographic features
