🏠 House Rent Prediction
This project aims to predict rental prices for housing properties based on key features such as size, location, furnishing status, and number of rooms. It demonstrates how real estate platforms can leverage machine learning to provide smarter recommendations aligned with a user’s budget.

📌 Problem Statement
Rent depends on several factors:
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
House size (sq. ft.)
Floor level and area type
City location and pin code
Furnishing status
Tenant preference
This project uses a deep learning model to predict house rent accurately based on historical data.

📁 Dataset Overview
📄 File: House_Rent_Dataset.csv
🔢 Records: 4,746
🎯 Target Variable: Rent
🧾 Key Features:
BHK, Size, Bathroom
Area Type, City, Furnishing Status, Tenant Preferred

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualized rent variation across cities by:
BHK configuration
Area type
Furnishing status
Property size
Used bar plots and pie charts for insights like tenant preferences and city-wise housing availability

🧠 Model Building
Categorical features mapped to numerical values
Normalized and split data into training/test sets
Built an LSTM Neural Network using Keras

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(7, 1)))
model.add(LSTM(64, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(25))
model.add(Dense(1))
Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error
Trained for 21 epochs

✅ Results
The model learned non-linear relationships between rent and property features
Sample Prediction:
Input → 3 BHK, 23 sq. ft., Semi-Furnished, 2 Baths
Output → Predicted Rent ≈ ₹42,608

🛠️ Future Improvements
Incorporate additional location-based features like landmarks, transport
Use advanced regression models or ensemble techniques
Hyperparameter tuning for better generalization
